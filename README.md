# Project

Suggestions for what to do are welcome.

What languages do you code in? I've been slowly teaching myself Python and wanted to try developing a Web scraper, or something similar, to grab the updated delivery time on my Woolies online orders. Do you use Woolies? Unlike Ocado in the UK they give you a window that updates, but you have to click on a link to get the updates. I wanted my Google calendar to get the updated time or maybe even send myself and email or text if the time updates.

Interested?
